# Web_Crawler
This repo contains crawlers I used in my projects or research. This repo will be updated with new methods and techniques loaded in scripts. Most of the work will be done using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). I haven't started using beautifulsoup up till now but will update the code if I required that library.
