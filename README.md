# Web_Crawler
This is a project in which i made a spider using scrapy and python
In this project I made a spider which crawls through this website "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=SMARTPHONE&qid=1559294616&ref=sr_pg_1" and scraps information about my search like:
  1.)Info of the phone
  2.)its rating
  3.)And its price.
 Due to amazon restriction sometimes its not possible to scrap data so I used Rotating User agent concept.
 It worked !!
